### **PS.**

I Feel like I should mention this as I've had a few people comment on it when I first started working on this pack about 7 months ago I intailly planned on naming it Age of Fate, so everything was based around that name, now 2 months ago I learned there was already a pack by that name, so I had to change it. So, any aspects of the pack that you see mention the former age of Fate name, if possible, can you make a suggestion ticket on GitHub so that I can find it and update it? Thank you, and enjoy. Â 

### **Fatebound: Scourge of the Damned**

_A hardcore RPG modpack where fate is a curse, and salvation is a lie._

#### **The Premise**

You areÂ **not the hero**. You are theÂ **damned**â€”a soul bound to a world rotting under an ancient Scourge. Demons hunt you. Curses fester in your gear. Every "gift" of power comes with a price. Survive long enough to unravel the truth:Â **the only way out is to embrace the darkness**.

#### **Features**

*   **Brutal Progression**: Permadeath mechanics, soul-bound items, and twisted RPG classes.
*   **The Scourge Grows**: Each boss slain corrupts the world further (custom mechanics).
*   **No Safe Havens**: Dimensions shift over timeâ€”even "sanctuary" is an illusion.
*   **Fate-Altering Quests**: Choices lock out paths or doom NPCs.
*   **Cursed Loot**: Legendary weaponsâ€¦ with horrific side effects.

#### **Mod Highlights**

*   **Combat**:Â _Tetra, Apotheosis, Vampirism_.
*   **Magic**:Â _Ars Nouveau, Blood Magic_.
*   **Horror**:Â _Graveyard, The Betweenlands_.
*   **Survival**:Â _Spice of Life, Tough as Nails_.

#### **Technical Notes**

*   **RAM**: 12GB minimum (15GB recommended).
*   **OptiFine**:Â **Incompatible**Â (useÂ _Rubidium + Oculus_Â for shaders).
*   **Performance**: IncludesÂ _Canary, Entity Culling_.

#### **Final Warning**
