Fatebound: Scourge of the Damned
A hardcore RPG modpack where fate is a curse, and salvation is a lie.

The Premise
You are not the hero. You are the damnedâ€”a soul bound to a world rotting under an ancient Scourge. Demons hunt you. Curses fester in your gear. Every "gift" of power comes with a price. Survive long enough to unravel the truth: the only way out is to embrace the darkness.

Features
Brutal Progression: Permadeath mechanics, soul-bound items, and twisted RPG classes.

The Scourge Grows: Each boss slain corrupts the world further (custom mechanics).

No Safe Havens: Dimensions shift over timeâ€”even "sanctuary" is an illusion.

Fate-Altering Quests: Choices lock out paths or doom NPCs.

Cursed Loot: Legendary weapons... with horrific side effects.

Mod Highlights
Combat: Tetra, Apotheosis, Vampirism.

Magic: Ars Nouveau, Blood Magic.

Horror: Graveyard, The Betweenlands.

Survival: Spice of Life, Tough as Nails.

Technical Notes
RAM: 8GB minimum (12GB recommended).

OptiFine: Incompatible (use Rubidium + Oculus for shaders).

Performance: Includes Canary, Entity Culling.

Final Warning
"The Scourge whispers to those who fail. Will you conquer itâ€”or become its herald?"
